### Python implementation of the equilibrium model of galaxy evolution

The equilibrium model is an analytic formalism to describe the evolution
of a set of baryonic galaxy properties, specifically the star formation
rate, gas fraction and metallicity [1]. After subsequent work on the
equilibrium model in [2], [3] and [4], this code now provides a Python
implementation of the formalism, complete with comments, adherence to
the PIP-8 coding conventions and references to research results used in
calculations at the locations of use. In addition, the relationship
between cosmological age and redshift is splined outside the primary
loop to avoid computing the redshift for each separate iteration.

### Quickstart
If you want to start quickly, 'equilibrium' only NEEDS four inputs:
(1) The final redshift to which the galaxy is evolved
(2) The initial halo mass as an exponential of base 10
(3) The hubble constant that is to be used by the code
(4) The matter density parameter (commonly as Omega_m)
In addition, thera are two optional parameters that can be set:
(5) The exponent used for calculating the ejective feedback parameter
    'eta' in the function 'eta_function()'
(6) The exponent used for calculating the gas fraction in 'gas_frac()'
An example with the four required parameters would look like this:
    
```python
from equilibrium import equilibrium_model

output = equilibrium_model(final_redshift = 0.0,
                           halo_mass = 8.2,
                           hubble_const = 70.0,
                           omega_matter = 0.3)
```
